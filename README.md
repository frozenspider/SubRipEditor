SubRipEditor
============

*Simple stand-alone editor for .srt subtitle files.*

I'd wish I could say that editor is lightweight, but it's hardly so due to Scala library size (runnable jar size currently is about 9 MB)

Editor is pretty simple and straightforward - e.g. it lacks media player integration
and it's unlikely it will be added later.


Assembly
--------

```
sbt assemby
```
with sbt 0.13.X will create a runnable jar in project root folder.
Don't forget to put `transliteration.conf` file near generated jar, or you won't be able to use transliterations.


Some usage details
------------------

*Transliterate* button serves for changing text written with incorrect keyboard layout on multi-lingual systems.
Currently only support English <--> Russian layout changes.

*Shift* buttons shifts time marks for subtitle entries in the editor for a given amount of milliseconds.

*Shift Before* and *Shift After* shifts all entries before/after selected entry (inclusive).


Planned features
----------------

* **Func:** add support for custom transliterations
* **Func:** add configurable options
* **Code:** clean it
* **Code:** improve test coverage

Known issues
------------

(Re-)loading a file causes selection indicator to disappear, but it remains in the same place for the purpose of relative shift-buttons and "Find Next"
